![Skjermbilde 2024-03-04 172709](https://github.com/Krihag/CodeUnity/assets/125905644/107bd955-8d96-4e02-bfeb-e40e00ac527b)

In this Course Assignment we were tasked on making a social media platform. The task was quite open, so we decided to make a platform for coders, called CodeUnity. 
The intention behind the platform was to create a space where coders can review each others projects, leave feedback, post updates and share tips. 
We also had the opportunity to work in pairs, and the project is therefore made by both Kristian Hages√¶ter and Martine Midttveit. 

## DESCRIPTION
The task said to implement the following elements, as well as additional content. 

- User with @noroff.no or @stud.noroff.no email can register profile
- Registered user can login
- User can view a post content feed
- User can filter the post content feed
- User can search the post content feed
- User can view a post content item by ID
- User can create a post content item
- User can update a post content item
- User can delete a post content item
- User can create a comment on a post
- User can edit profile media
- User can follow/unfollow a profile
- User can react to a post content item

## COLLABORATION
By working together we've learned a lot from each other. It has been a great exercise and we've worked together really well, even though we have different ways of coding. 
We have worked together every single day on Discord, collaborating through streaming and live share, and delegated tasks between us. We have tried to work mostly together, instead of individually, to learn as much as we could.

### Planning the project
To plan the project, we made a Trello-board with checklists and color themes based on how timeconsuming the different tasks would be. By making the Trello-board it was also easier to work structured and keep it organized all the way through the project.
This is the link to our Trello-board:
